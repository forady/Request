# You are the Subject to My Poems

We've known each other for quite some time now but we gotten closer lately since we are sharing the same pain. I know you only see me as a friend but is it what is it. Please listen to the message of the song as well. It shows accuraccy in expressing what I feel as of the moment Bal. I just want to know more about you Bal. 

I also want to let you know you've been a source of inspiration and joy in my life, and I wanted you to know that you're more than just a passing thought. Your presence has a way of brightening my day, and I find myself drawn to the positivity and warmth you radiate.

I've been admiring you from afar, not because I'm lonely or sad, but because I genuinely appreciate the wonderful person you are. There's something about the way you carry yourself, your kindness, and the genuine care you show towards others that has captured my heart. 

It's not about making things awkward or putting any pressure on you. I just wanted to be honest and open about the admiration I have for you. Life is too short not to express our feelings, and I believe in going with the flow, letting things unfold naturally. 

In the tapestry of life, remember that each thread, including the past, contributes to the beautiful masterpiece that you are becoming. Don't let it be a prison, but a lesson that shapes your strength and wisdom.

As you journey through life, remember that you're never alone. Regardless of the world's neglect or misunderstanding, God's unwavering presence offers constant comfort. Embrace His love, allowing it to empower you to confront every challenge with courage and grace.

Whatever your response may be, I value our connection and friendship, and I'm grateful for the joy you bring into my life. May God's love keep us connected, and may your heart always find peace in His embrace.
