# You are the  Subject to My Poems

You've been a source of inspiration and joy in my life, and I wanted you to know that you're more than just a passing thought. Your presence has a way of brightening my day, and I find myself drawn to the positivity and warmth you radiate.

I've been admiring you from afar, not because I'm lonely or sad, but because I genuinely appreciate the wonderful person you are. There's something about the way you carry yourself, your kindness, and the genuine care you show towards others that has captured my heart.

It's not about making things awkward or putting any pressure on you; I just wanted to be honest and open about the admiration I have for you. Life is too short not to express our feelings, and I believe in going with the flow, letting things unfold naturally.

In the tapestry of life, remember that each thread, including the past, contributes to the beautiful masterpiece that you are becoming. Don't let it be a prison, but a lesson that shapes your strength and wisdom.

Hold on to your faith, and never forget that God is with you, even in the moments when the world may seem indifferent. Your commitment to being a God-fearing person is a testament to the radiant spirit you possess. Let His love be your refuge and strength.

As you navigate through life, know that you are never alone. Even if the world neglects or misunderstands you, God's unwavering presence remains a constant source of comfort. Embrace His love, and may it empower you to face every challenge with courage and grace.

Whatever your response may be, I value our connection and friendship, and I'm grateful for the joy you bring into my life. Regardless of the paths we take, may God's love bind us together, and may your heart always find solace in His everlasting embrace.
